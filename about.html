								<p> Hello everyone, or I should say 你好! My name is Maisie Liu (劉小嫚), currently completing my Masters of Science in Information Management
									at the University of Washington! Go Dawgs! Forgot to mention, I am from Taiwan, where boba milk tea orginated. So you can see me holding
									a boba in my little avatar🧋🙋🏻‍♀️. This is my 7th year studying abroad and my 5th year in Seattle, WA and I am excited to either relocate to
									another city or stay in Seattle!!
								</p>
								<p>Professionally, I am a data analyst with a background in food systems, nutrition and health. Many may think that this is a hard pivot, 
									but I think there is a strong connection in between. Food systems equipped me with the ability to think systematically and take many stakeholder
									into consideration. Being in the Food Systems program, I was able to understand the different perspectives and find the best solutions for everyone.
									Not only that, Food Systems also allowed me to initially touch on data and making data-driven decisions, which lead me to improving my technical skills
									in my masters program!	
								</p>
								<p>In my free time, I like to explore the new cafes ☕️ and restuarants 🍲 around Seattle! I also like to travel ✈️! Last year, I reached my goal of visiting
									three different cities in the U.S. (Las Vegas, Pheonix, and Washington D.C.). I hope I can travel to many other cities in the U.S. and be
									able to learn about the very local cities within the next 5 years! And to keep those memories, I've recently picked up the habit of taking more photos
									day-to-day so I'll be able to scroll through the photos and think about the good old times. Please see the Personal Life tab if you'd like to see my photo collections!
								</p>
								<p>Many people say I am a quick-learner, being able to pick up knowledge quick and be very good at it. But I consider this because I like challenges.
									I like to try new things. You can definitely see this from how I traveled over 6,000 miles to pursue a dream of studying abroad. (I'd also say
									many thanks to my parents support) <br>

									If you'd like to know me more, feel free to chat and reach out!! I really enjoy the chance to chat and know more about others!
								</p>
